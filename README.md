## Simple eCommerce Webpage

A simple eCommerce webpage that allows users to browse products, view product details, add products to the cart, and make simple transactions. This project is a basic prototype that mimics some of the core functionalities of Amazon.

## Features

- **Product Details**: Click on a product to see more information.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add products to the shopping cart and view cart details.
- **Checkout**: Basic checkout flow with placeholder for user details.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure and layout of the page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout (includes responsiveness).
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic features such as adding items to the cart and calculating totals.
- **Local Storage (Optional)**: To store cart data between sessions.
